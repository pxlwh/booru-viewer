"""Pure-Python state machine for the popout viewer.

This module is the source of truth for the popout's lifecycle. All
state transitions, all decisions about which effects to fire on which
events, and all of the persistent fields (`viewport`, `mute`, `volume`,
`seek_target_ms`, etc.) live here. The Qt-side adapter in
`popout/window.py` is responsible only for translating Qt events into
state machine events and applying the returned effects to widgets.

**Hard constraint**: this module MUST NOT import anything from PySide6,
mpv, httpx, subprocess, or any module that does. The state machine's
test suite imports it directly without standing up a `QApplication` —
if those imports fail, the tests fail to collect, and the test suite
becomes the forcing function that keeps this module pure.

The architecture, state diagram, invariant→transition mapping, and
event/effect lists are documented in `docs/POPOUT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
This module's job is to be the executable form of that document.

This is the **commit 2 skeleton**: every state, every event type, every
effect type, and the `StateMachine` class with all fields initialized.
The `dispatch` method routes events to per-event handlers that all
currently return empty effect lists. Real transitions land in
commits 4-11 of `docs/POPOUT_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.

        Only valid input in PlayingVideo. In every other state — most
        importantly LoadingVideo, where the stale-eof race lived —
        the event is dropped without changing state or emitting
        effects. This is the structural fix: the previous fix used
        a wall-clock window to suppress eof events arriving within
        250ms of `play_file`; the state machine subsumes that by
        only accepting eof when we're actually in PlayingVideo.

        In PlayingVideo:
        - Loop=Next: emit EmitPlayNextRequested so main_window
          advances to the next post.
        - Loop=Once: emit nothing — mpv with keep_open=yes naturally
          pauses at the end of the file. No state transition; the
          user can manually click Play to restart.
        - Loop=Loop: emit nothing — mpv's loop-file=inf handles
          the restart internally.
